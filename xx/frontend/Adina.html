			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h2>
				My name is Zhanibek. I am Adina's brother and decided to create a website for her since I started going to the programming in the Clevers center.Since this is my first experience, here you will not be able to find a lot of things, but one thing I can say for sure is that I really liked the process itself and I hope you like it too.

			<h1>Adina's blog</h1>
			<h2>
				Let's start with the fact that she is 9 years older than me. It would be a big difference, but Adina replaced all my friends and acquaintances,with her I can go and play something.She never refuses me, and will explain any incomprehensible things, there were even moments when we fought with her (P.s very often)
                My sister is older than me and always helps me with my studies. She is an example for me, as she is very smart and accurate.But her advantage in age sometimes hurts me, in those moments, I want to be an older child, as in childhood she was too smart for her age and if my memory serves, she stepped over grade 1, so parents and not only they always said be like her. On the one hand, they were right, but on the other, it was even scary.If i did something
                wrong it could have ruined a sister's rehearsal
